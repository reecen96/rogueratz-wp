# Rogue Ratz History

Rogue Ratz share history with the surface

By Serena Massof an Investigative Reporter tasks with reporting on the Rogue Ratz.

SOLANA CITY— Many remember the riots taking over large swaths of Solana City when the Rogue Ratz revealed themselves in 1998. When humanity’s knee-jerk reaction sent the Ratz scurrying back into the sewers, both sides lost an opportunity for mutual understanding and cooperation. A new generation of Ratz brings another chance to get things right. 

The late Rogue Ratz King Gregory Gorgonzola hoped for peace between the Ratz of Solana Sewers and the humans on the surface, believing all were citizens of Solana City. Just before the turn of the century, the Ratz were unified under King Gorgonzola. According to the few surviving records of the time that the Ratz possess, King Gorgonzola led them to the surface, hoping to integrate into human society. 

Then-Mayor Brock Portculli reacted with fear and xenophobia, urging the people of Solana City to push the “invaders” back into the “sewers where they belong.” The Rogue Ratz retreated and became a sort of open secret in the city. Without another attempt to move aboveground, the Ratz faded from popular memory into myth. Mayor Portculli was not reelected and has since moved to Europe. While the former mayor is no longer in power, his arrest-on-sight law remains on the Solana City books, making the surface unsafe for the Ratz. All captured Ratz are taken to a special prison nicknamed the Rat Trap. 

Efforts to contact the Rogue Ratz have been shaky at best during the intervening years. Many with the power to enact change don’t believe the Ratz are real, let alone a society of marginalized sentient humanoid beings deserving of basic rights. 

Little is known about the origins of the Rogue Ratz due to sparsely recorded history in the early years and their short lifespans. What they do know is rats began mutating sometime in the early 1980s in the sewer underneath a location later determined to be the main SolaCorp chemical factory. Among the early mutations was a drastic increase in intelligence and life span. Rather than living only two years, the alleged toxic waste dumped by SolaCorp extended the rat lifespan to 10 years, which also gave them ample time to continue mutating and pass on altered genes. 

SolaCorp has been a fixture of the Solana City business community for decades. They employ thousands of people and make millions in political contributions each year. Investigations have been launched to look into SolaCorp’s waste disposal procedures during the ‘80s. This reporter has also discovered an illicit connection between SolaCorp and the former mayor, perhaps shedding some light on his hard anti-Ratz stance while in office.

Having no use for human money in the sewers, the Ratz developed an economic system using various kinds of cheese as currency, as the delicacy was considered the most valuable thing they could possess. It is worth noting that Solana City’s cheese producers have seen a 70 percent increase in overall sales since the early 1990s. It would seem the Crooks’ black market indeed has ways of conducting business with the world above them.

The first few generations of Rogue Ratz in their current evolution were content to live among themselves in small groups. Eventually, they came together and expressed a desire for leadership. Young rat Gregory Gorgonzola was declared King of the Ratz by unanimous decision. King Gorgonzola was widely known as a noble, selfless rat. He ruled for most of his life, serving nine years as a servant of his people.

Under King Gorgonzola’s leadership, the Ratz attempted to migrate to the surface in 1998. They were met with extreme violence and retreated into the sewers. The king passed away a few days after the failed migration, leaving behind a power vacuum. This issue will be explored in a separate article. After the king’s death, his daughter, Princess Katherine Gorgonzola took power. Surviving histories indicate that while well-intentioned, Queen Gorgonzola lacked the experience and wisdom to navigate the trials of the monarchy.

Without a strong leader to unite and guide them, the Rouge Ratz community underwent a period of unrest, and living under a monarch was soon no longer a desirable situation for many of the Ratz. 
The Ratz community shattered roughly a year after King Gorgonzola’s death. The monarchy was dissolved and the Ratz split into three like-minded factions. Those three factions remain the ruling power structure in the Solana Sewers today. According to representatives from each gang, they take their aesthetic from groups they identify with from human culture. The Ratz are not ignorant of the surface world, as many unexpected things wind up in the sewers and a thriving black market means a great deal of human culture can be found among the Ratz. 

The three Ratz factions are the Academics, the Hillbillies, and the Crooks. Each group will be the subject of an in-depth investigative article. Some of the Ratz say they would like to attempt integrating with the surface world, while others are content with the separation and would rather focus their time on leisure pursuits. 

Each of the factions reveres its founders as legends. Power passed to their children upon their deaths, but with the Ratz lifespan, those children have already passed on, each of them with no heirs, once again plunging the Solana Sewers into chaos as another power vacuum looms. The current Rogue Ratz population in the sewers is approximately 4,848, according to the annual census conducted by the Academics.

Upon learning the true history of the Rogue Ratz, one must consider whether these sentient creatures deserve a life relegated to the sewers, which are unsanitary at best and outright deadly at worst. What defines a person? The ability to speak, form a society, and take action to solve problems? By those qualifications, the Rogue Ratz are people, too and they deserve better.

The Solana Tribune would like to hear from readers about their opinions on the Rogue Ratz and how the city should deal with this population of creatures who have far more in common with humans than any other species on the planet.
