# The Academics

Academic Rogue Ratz seek knowledge, life on the surface

By Serena Massof

SOLANA CITY— Shortly after the monarchy of Queen Gorgonzola was dissolved, the Rogue Ratz community fractured into three factions. This article delves into the history of the Academics gang, founded by Sir Alfred Gouda, and what inspires these Ratz.

The Academics make their home in the sewers underneath the Solana Public Library. The gang’s records are extensive from the point of their founding on, something the other gangs lack. They shared their knowledge readily enough, as the Academics seek a partnership with the surface world where they would be free to continue learning. 

Before Sir Alfred Gouda, reading was seen as a luxury only available to the incredibly wealthy. He found a book washed up in the sewer and taught himself to read. Sir Gouda quickly gathered a following of like-minded Ratz and formed the Academics gang. 

The Academics favor an elegant high-society aesthetic. They prefer brie cheese and crackers served on an ornate table and particularly enjoy fine dining among friends. Their favorite pastimes include reading novels and studying literature to discuss with one another, as well as watching intellectual movies that promote intelligent conversation.

Their area of the Solana Sewers is inundated with green. The Academics’ clothes, their walls, and even many of their personal items. It feels almost like walking into a park on the surface. Perhaps that is why the Academics favor it so much? 

Several personality traits become apparent upon spending a significant amount of time with the Academics. They are intelligent, sophisticated, and proud, but they also tend toward arrogance and self-entitlement. Members of the other gangs said the Academics have a superior attitude, bordering on rude, regarding other Ratz, while idolizing humans. The Academics, however, insist they are “merely selective about those with whom they choose to associate.”

Rumors in the Solana Sewers indicate the Academics are “obsessed with becoming human” and that they have a secret lab deep in the sewers where they are working on a serum that would allow them to become human. This reporter witnessed no evidence of a lab or any kind of serum, though they did not answer any questions related to the rumors. 

Sufficient evidence exists to suggest that members of the Academics partake in the thriving black market run by the Crooks. Several gang members said they despise the necessity, but “no one can procure goods like the Crooks.” While the Academics shun the pleasure-seeking behaviors of the other two gangs, they do admit the others have their usefulness. 

Academics members said they would like more control over the Rogue Ratz community to improve the public relations between Ratz and humans.
