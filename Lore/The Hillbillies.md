# The Crooks

Reclusive Rogue Ratz Crooks shun human world

SOLANA CITY— Just like the humans above, the Rogue Ratz have a criminal element. The self-proclaimed Crooks gang runs the thriving black market that supplies goods to all the Solana Sewers, as well as growing the “sweetest, stinkiest weed in town,” according to one Crooks member. 

Many of the Crooks shun humanity entirely and refused to share their experiences for this article. However, after some persuasion, and this reporter suspects, bribery from the Academics, the Crooks agreed to appoint a team of Ratz to speak. 

The Crooks formed under the guidance of Charlene “Charlie” Cheddar. Before the Ratz monarchy fell, Cheddar was already an accomplished thief. Surviving records indicate that when humanity rejected the Ratz, Cheddar rejected them right back. She had absolutely no respect for human laws or property ownership. If she could steal it from the surface, it was hers. 

Cheddar made a fortune for herself stealing from ships in the Solana Harbor, but she was eventually caught by a sailor. According to stories passed down through the ranks of the Crooks, Cheddar said she was scared the sailor would turn her over to the police. In accordance with the law, the police would immediately take her to the Rat Trap, the specially designed prison former Mayor Portculli built to hold Rogue Ratz. However, the sailor was impressed by Cheddar’s skill and proposed a partnership instead. 

The sailor, who remains unnamed in every record available, offered Cheddar a job sneaking illicit goods into Solana City via the sewer system. She was reluctant to partner with a human at first, but Cheddar ultimately agreed, and the Solana black market was born. 

Cheddar proved to be adept as a criminal mastermind. She joined the ranks of the Solana City underworld crime scene, where she quickly became a power player— above and below ground. Before the law banning marijuana was changed, records indicate a bag containing live seeds was thrown into the sewer and Cheddar seized the opportunity to expand her empire. Thanks to the lingering traces of the original toxic contamination that mutated the Ratz, the marijuana strain they produce, Super Green Sewer Slime, is dominating the markets, both through illicit and recently, legal channels. 

Rumors among the gangs say the Crooks are working with multiple strains in the hopes of creating the most potent marijuana known to both humans and Ratz. 

The Crooks’ area of the Solana Sewers is slathered in red, perhaps as a warning to keep out the unwelcome. While most of the Crooks wear red in some fashion, those who must commit their thievery in the shadows tend to do so in a more discreet fashion. They wear splashes of red in the form of accessories to their black wardrobes, which help them remain unseen on the surface. 
Members of the Crooks do not shy away from the illegality of their interests. Many said their hobbies included stealing, selling narcotics, and playing pranks— particularly on humans. They also enjoy hoarding items and playing video games. The Crooks proudly showed off a massive flat-screen television and a series of gaming systems. 

“We stole them right off the truck and they didn’t see a thing!” said Crooks member Benedict Bleu. 

Personality traits are difficult to gauge among a group so standoffish to humans, but there are several commonalities among the Crooks. They are reclusive to both humans and other Ratz gangs. They are friendly and open only among other Crooks. These Ratz are openly sneaky and easily agitated, with edgy attitudes that often place them at odds with others. 

Whether the Crooks continue their lawless ways or branch into more legitimate avenues of business remains to be seen, but many residents of Solana City are eager to learn more about the most reclusive of the Rogue Ratz population.
