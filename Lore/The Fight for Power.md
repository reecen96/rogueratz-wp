# The Fight for Power

Power vacuum after Rat King’s death, history repeats itself

By Serena Massof

SOLANA CITY — Rogue Ratz King Gregory Gorgonzola was injured in the failed 1998 migration to the surface. He passed away mere days later, from complications related to the injuries, according to records kept by the Academics.

In the wake of the king’s death, Princess Katherine Gorgonzola ascended to the throne. She tried valiantly to uphold the kingdom her father kept united under his rule, but civil unrest among the Rogue Ratz community soon led to further issues. 

Riots destroyed a large portion of what had formerly served as a communal area open to all. Looters grabbed what they could and claimed portions of the space for their individual “gangs.” The royal family’s cheese stores were raided, and most of the Gorgonzola fortune was lost overnight. 

Queen Gorgonzola struggled to lead her people for nearly a year, but ultimately the people decided they didn’t want to live under a single ruler. The monarchy was dissolved and the resulting power vacuum among the Ratz led to even more strife in the sewers. 

According to surviving records, many of which were passed down orally through the generations, the first few months after the dissolution of the monarchy were pure chaos. Many Ratz fled deep into the sewers seeking safety in solitude. Others fought to carve new kingdoms for themselves, no matter the cost. Thankfully, this discord wouldn’t last long.

Those remaining in the main area of the sewers split into the three factions in which they remain today thanks to three visionary Ratz. United behind their leaders, who are gone but remembered as legends, the gangs of the Academics, Hillbillies, and Crooks were formed, and an uneasy peace was found at last. 

Sir Alfred Gouda gathered all those who sought learning together to form the Academics and claimed the territory beneath the Solana City Public Library. Billy Brie turned his love of music and moonshine into an empire under the city’s oldest bakery with his laid-back Ratz companions as the leader of the Hillbillies. Self-proclaimed entrepreneur Charlene “Charlie” Cheddar knew any kingdom required supplies and formed the Crooks to set up an effective black-market system that still procures resources for the entire Rogue Ratz community. 

Individual articles profiling each gang will be part of this series. Interested readers should watch the Solana Tribune for more information about each subset of the Rogue Ratz population. 
With the shortened lifespan of Ratz, each of the leaders’ children has risen to the top and passed on without heirs. Now, all three gangs face a power vacuum and the potential for chaos once again rumbles through the Solana Sewers. Each gang seeks to take over the sewers to further their own goals.
