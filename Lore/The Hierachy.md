Hierarchy of the Rogue Ratz society

By Serena Massof

SOLANA CITY — With the Rogue Ratz community once more thrown into the midst of a power vacuum, each of the three gangs is recruiting “civilian” Ratz to fill their ranks. While the Academics, Crooks, and Hillbillies gangs are all currently without formal leadership, the highest-ranking members have elected to host an initiation event where they can find new Ratz who best meet their values— and potentially a new Gang Boss for each of the three groups. 

All unaffiliated Ratz are considered “Civilians” by the gangs. They are free to roam the unclaimed areas of the sewers but receive no support from any of the three gangs. Civilian Ratz must fend for themselves and find their own methods to gather the cheese required to purchase necessities. 

If one of the Ratz is chosen by a gang, they must pay an initiation fee, which secures their room and board with the gang. Ratz can then either bribe their way up the hierarchy with cheese or work for the good of the gang to earn the respect of their fellow members. 

Once Ratz have undergone the initiation, they become novice “Gang Members,” who serve to do the grunt work of the gang. They do the bidding of their superiors, with more completed tasks earning them additional respect in the gang, which helps them advance. While the novices don’t earn much in terms of cheese, they do earn enough to survive. Gang members also have a strong bond with their fellow gang Ratz. 

After Ratz have earned enough respect and experience in the gang, they can advance to the intermediate “Captain” level. These Ratz help keep the lower gang members in check, ensuring none of them get into mischief. Captains earn more cheese than novice gang members. One of their chief roles is to coordinate social events for the gang. Captains seem to serve as the glue that holds the tight-knit gangs together. 

At the top of the pecking order is the Gang Boss. These Ratz are the wealthiest and most experienced. Gang Bosses are entitled to the largest portions of the gang’s cheese supplies. They are the most respected among the ranks and tend to live in the most luxurious living quarters. Rumors have spread among the sewers that gang bosses have furniture made from pure chhurpi cheese. For those who are not cheese aficionados, chhurpi is the hardest cheese in the world. 

Once attaining the position of gang boss, Ratz are given a rare serum to further alter their genetics. One of the main effects of this is the gang boss grows hair, which helps to differentiate them from the lower tier Ratz. Gang bosses are the only ones capable of organizing raids on rival gangs, as well as negotiating treaties with other gang bosses. 

The Rogue Ratz were not especially forthcoming about the details of the initiation, but according to available reports, prospective members can expect to face a philosophy exam, sneaking test, fitness challenge, and a banjo contest over the course of three days. 

The Academics said they are looking for potential members with certain qualities. Ideal candidates enjoy consuming and discussing literature and philosophy. These Ratz tend to be perfectionists who demand excellence. They are all organized and present themselves with a prim and proper attitude and elegant aesthetic. 

Those Ratz hoping to join the Crooks would be skilled in the areas of sneakiness and deception. All potential Crooks must be brave, as their lifestyle comes with quite a bit of danger and risk. Fitness is a must for these Ratz because running from the Solana City Police will be guaranteed gang activity. Ideal Crooks candidates are carefree, with a relaxed attitude toward laws, and deep enjoyment of adrenaline-fueled pursuits.

The Hillbillies are slightly more relaxed when it comes to their requirements. Chief among their requests for prospective members is the ability to hold their liquor. As many know, the Hillbillies are known for their potent moonshine. Musical talent is a plus, but not necessarily required. However, a love of music—country in particular— is an absolute necessity. Hard-working Ratz with excellent marksmanship will be ideal candidates for this gang. 

With the human residents of Solana City now fully aware of the Rogue Ratz, could potential migration to the surface be on the horizon for the city’s sewer population? Or will the subterranean citizens remain separate? Keep an eye on the Solana Tribune for more information on this developing story as it becomes available.
