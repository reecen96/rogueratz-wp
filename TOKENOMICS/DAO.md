# The Tokenomics Model

# DAO

Each gang is managed by a DAO - Gang Bosses and Gang members need to work together to build the strongest sustainable gang. Gang Bosses will be able to make proposals to the Gang DAO whilst Gang Members will be able to vote on these proposals.

Each gang member can buy upgrades for their gang, for example weapons, Ammo & Medkits. Big ticket strategic purchases are made by the Gang DAOs. These upgrades have a much larger effect on the gangs success such as Moonshine Distilleries, Skateparks & other infrastructure. 

The strongest gang will take all the cheese.

Rogue Ratz offers three tokens in the DAO Model, to provide each Gang with the ability to make proposals and vote - Providing direction for the Rogue Ratz project:

**$BOSSBH :**
 
 This token is used by Gang Bosses to make proposals to the gang. Gang bosses for the **Hillbilly Gang** receive this when staking. 

**$BOSSC :**

This token is used by Gang Bosses to make proposals to the gang. Gang bosses for the **Crooks Gang** receive this when staking. 

**$BOSSA :** 

This token is used by Gang Bosses to make proposals to the gang. Gang bosses from the **Academics Gang** receive this when staking.
