# The Tokenomics Model

## Tokens

Rogue Ratz will introduce a dual-token economy model. The advantages of utilising two SPL Tokens for the platform include additional financial incentive, structure, features, and utility for the holders. Obscuring a liquidity backed token from the in game currency will give greater control over growth & inflationary pressures of the token - ensuring sustainable growth. 

Our tokenomics have been built from the ground up to be deflationary. $CHEESE & $CRED will be burnt on each transaction. 

Utilising the token swap model, balancing the value and benefits for the tokens is made easy.

Rogue Ratz offers two tokens in the P2E model, to provide you with economic benefit:

**$CRED :**

 Is used withinin the P2E Ratz economy to buy upgrades, equipment and infrastructure to build up gangs. Importantly $CRED is also used to upgrade Gang Ratz. The value of credit will be controlled by the Rogue Ratz team - this will assist in controlling inflationary pressures on the coin & will assist in the longevity of the economy.

**$CHEESE :**

 Is a liquidity backed token that will be used to power the Rogue Ratz Economy. $CHEESE can be converted to $USDC or used to purchase Raffle tickets, purchase NFTs from the Auction house or be converted to $CRED for P2E upgrades & fusion.

Rogue Ratz offers three tokens in the DAO Model, to provide each Gang with the ability to make proposals and vote - Providing direction for the Rogue Ratz project:

**$BOSSBH :** 

This token is used by Gang Bosses to make proposals to the gang. Gang bosses for the **Hillbilly Gang** receive this when staking. 

**$BOSSC :**

This token is used by Gang Bosses to make proposals to the gang. Gang bosses for the **Crooks Gang** receive this when staking. 

**$BOSSA :** 

This token is used by Gang Bosses to make proposals to the gang. Gang bosses from the **Academics Gang** receive this when staking.
