# Who are the Rogue Ratz?

**Who are the Rogue Ratz?**

Rogue Ratz is a collection of 4,848 unique and aesthetically pleasing 3D Ratz. The Rogue Ratz exist within the underworld of Solana, living life in the Solana Sewers and their world is encompassed by gangs battling for power. 

As the Solana universe rapidly expanded above ground, commercial greed escalated and companies started storing nuclear waste in the sewers to save on costs.  During this time, the radioactive waste in the sewers had cause the common rats to mutate into what we now know as the Rogue Ratz.

The Rogue Ratz are a species of mutated rodents living in the Solana Sewers. Appearances aside, they are mostly decent creatures, living life to the fullest through any means necessary. 

In their leisure time the Rogue Ratz enjoy surfing the sewer rapids, skating around, relaxing on lawn chairs, playing music, tripping out, playing video games, smoking up and sleeping.

However, it's not all fun and games within the sewers. There are three main gangs that exist within the Rogeu Ratz underworld: The Academics, The Crooks and the Hillbillies. 

These gangs all have an expansive history, unique culture and fascinating identity. There is a sense of community and belonging within each gang, however, their pleasantries don't extend to their rivals. 

The three gangs are locked in a brutal turf war, as greed has taken over and the fight for ***$CHEEZE*** is never-ending.
