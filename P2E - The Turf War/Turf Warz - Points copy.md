Making it to the top has its perks. Gang bosses head the Academic, Hillbilly & Thieve Gangs. Gang Bosses propose decisions to the Gangs whilst Gang members vote on these proposals. 

To become a Gang Boss - You'll need to earn your stripes, take out a traitor within your own gang to show your fellow gang bangers you deserve their respect.Gang Bosses are unlocked through a burning mechanism.

Gang Bosses also receive bonus Cheese rewards - making them the biggest earners in sewers.

There is a set limit on the number of Gang Bosses, but all Ratz will have their chance to become a Gang Boss and control the gang together with the other bosses.
