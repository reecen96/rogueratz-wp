Power passed to their children upon their deaths, but with the Ratz lifespan, those children have already passed on, each of them with no heirs, once again plunging the Solana Sewers into chaos as another power vacuum looms. The current Rogue Ratz population in the sewers is approximately 4,848, according to the annual census conducted by the Academics.","Efforts to contact the Rogue Ratz have been shaky at best during the intervening years. Many with the power to enact change don’t believe the Ratz are real, let alone a society of marginalized sentient humanoid beings deserving of basic rights.","Having no use for human money in the sewers, the Ratz developed an economic system using various kinds of cheese as currency, as the delicacy was considered the most valuable thing they could possess. It is worth noting that Solana City’s cheese producers have seen a 70 percent increase in overall sales since the early 1990s. It would seem the Crooks’ black market indeed has ways of conducting business with the world above them.","Little is known about the origins of the Rogue Ratz due to sparsely recorded history in the early years and their short lifespans. What they do know is rats began mutating sometime in the early 1980s in the sewer underneath a location later determined to be the main SolaCorp chemical factory. Among the early mutations was a drastic increase in intelligence and life span. Rather than living only two years, the alleged toxic waste dumped by SolaCorp extended the rat lifespan to 10 years, which also gave them ample time to continue mutating and pass on altered genes.","Rogue Ratz share history with the surface","SolaCorp has been a fixture of the Solana City business community for decades. They employ thousands of people and make millions in political contributions each year. Investigations have been launched to look into SolaCorp’s waste disposal procedures during the ‘80s. This reporter has also discovered an illicit connection between SolaCorp and the former mayor, perhaps shedding some light on his hard anti-Ratz stance while in office.","SOLANA CITY— Many remember the riots taking over large swaths of Solana City when the Rogue Ratz revealed themselves in 1998. When humanity’s knee-jerk reaction sent the Ratz scurrying back into the sewers, both sides lost an opportunity for mutual understanding and cooperation. A new generation of Ratz brings another chance to get things right.","The first few generations of Rogue Ratz in their current evolution were content to live among themselves in small groups. Eventually, they came together and expressed a desire for leadership. Young rat Gregory Gorgonzola was declared King of the Ratz by unanimous decision. King Gorgonzola was widely known as a noble, selfless rat. He ruled for most of his life, serving nine years as a servant of his people.","The late Rogue Ratz King Gregory Gorgonzola hoped for peace between the Ratz of Solana Sewers and the humans on the surface, believing all were citizens of Solana City. Just before the turn of the century, the Ratz were unified under King Gorgonzola. According to the few surviving records of the time that the Ratz possess, King Gorgonzola led them to the surface, hoping to integrate into human society.","The Solana Tribune would like to hear from readers about their opinions on the Rogue Ratz and how the city should deal with this population of creatures who have far more in common with humans than any other species on the planet.","The three Ratz factions are the Academics, the Hillbillies, and the Crooks. Each group will be the subject of an in-depth investigative article. Some of the Ratz say they would like to attempt integrating with the surface world, while others are content with the separation and would rather focus their time on leisure pursuits.","Then-Mayor Brock Portculli reacted with fear and xenophobia, urging the people of Solana City to push the “invaders” back into the “sewers where they belong.” The Rogue Ratz retreated and became a sort of open secret in the city. Without another attempt to move aboveground, the Ratz faded from popular memory into myth. Mayor Portculli was not reelected and has since moved to Europe. While the former mayor is no longer in power, his arrest-on-sight law remains on the Solana City books, making the surface unsafe for the Ratz. All captured Ratz are taken to a special prison nicknamed the Rat Trap.","Under King Gorgonzola’s leadership, the Ratz attempted to migrate to the surface in 1998. They were met with extreme violence and retreated into the sewers. The king passed away a few days after the failed migration, leaving behind a power vacuum. This issue will be explored in a separate article. After the king’s death, his daughter, Princess Katherine Gorgonzola took power. Surviving histories indicate that while well-intentioned, Queen Gorgonzola lacked the experience and wisdom to navigate the trials of the monarchy.","Upon learning the true history of the Rogue Ratz, one must consider whether these sentient creatures deserve a life relegated to the sewers, which are unsanitary at best and outright deadly at worst. What defines a person? The ability to speak, form a society, and take action to solve problems? By those qualifications, the Rogue Ratz are people, too and they deserve better.","Without a strong leader to unite and guide them, the Rouge Ratz community underwent a period of unrest, and living under a monarch was soon no longer a desirable situation for many of the Ratz. The Ratz community shattered roughly a year after King Gorgonzola’s death. The monarchy was dissolved and the Ratz split into three like-minded factions. Those three factions remain the ruling power structure in the Solana Sewers today. According to representatives from each gang, they take their aesthetic from groups they identify with from human culture. The Ratz are not ignorant of the surface world, as many unexpected things wind up in the sewers and a thriving black market means a great deal of human culture can be found among the Ratz."]}],[{"l":"The Fight for Power","p":["Power vacuum after Rat King’s death, history repeats itself","By Serena Massof","Investigative Reporter","SOLANA CITY — Rogue Ratz King Gregory Gorgonzola was injured in the failed 1998 migration to the surface. He passed away mere days later, from complications related to the injuries, according to records kept by the Academics.","In the wake of the king’s death, Princess Katherine Gorgonzola ascended to the throne. She tried valiantly to uphold the kingdom her father kept united under his rule, but civil unrest among the Rogue Ratz community soon led to further issues.","Riots destroyed a large portion of what had formerly served as a communal area open to all. Looters grabbed what they could and claimed portions of the space for their individual “gangs.” The royal family’s cheese stores were raided, and most of the Gorgonzola fortune was lost overnight.","Queen Gorgonzola struggled to lead her people for nearly a year, but ultimately the people decided they didn’t want to live under a single ruler. The monarchy was dissolved and the resulting power vacuum among the Ratz led to even more strife in the sewers.","According to surviving records, many of which were passed down orally through the generations, the first few months after the dissolution of the monarchy were pure chaos. Many Ratz fled deep into the sewers seeking safety in solitude. Others fought to carve new kingdoms for themselves, no matter the cost. Thankfully, this discord wouldn’t last long.","Those remaining in the main area of the sewers split into the three factions in which they remain today thanks to three visionary Ratz. United behind their leaders, who are gone but remembered as legends, the gangs of the Academics, Hillbillies, and Crooks were formed, and an uneasy peace was found at last.","Sir Alfred Gouda gathered all those who sought learning together to form the Academics and claimed the territory beneath the Solana City Public Library. Billy Brie turned his love of music and moonshine into an empire under the city’s oldest bakery with his laid-back Ratz companions as the leader of the Hillbillies. Self-proclaimed entrepreneur Charlene “Charlie” Cheddar knew any kingdom required supplies and formed the Crooks to set up an effective black-market system that still procures resources for the entire Rogue Ratz community.","Individual articles profiling each gang will be part of this series. Interested readers should watch the Solana Tribune for more information about each subset of the Rogue Ratz population. With the shortened lifespan of Ratz, each of the leaders’ children has risen to the top and passed on without heirs. Now, all three gangs face a power vacuum and the potential for chaos once again rumbles through the Solana Sewers. Each gang seeks to take over the sewers to further their own goals."]}],[{"l":"The Hierachy","p":["Hierarchy of the Rogue Ratz society","By Serena Massof","Investigative Reporter","SOLANA CITY — With the Rogue Ratz community once more thrown into the midst of a power vacuum, each of the three gangs is recruiting “civilian” Ratz to fill their ranks. While the Academics, Crooks, and Hillbillies gangs are all currently without formal leadership, the highest-ranking members have elected to host an initiation event where they can find new Ratz who best meet their values— and potentially a new Gang Boss for each of the three groups.","All unaffiliated Ratz are considered “Civilians” by the gangs. They are free to roam the unclaimed areas of the sewers but receive no support from any of the three gangs. Civilian Ratz must fend for themselves and find their own methods to gather the cheese required to purchase necessities.","If one of the Ratz is chosen by a gang, they must pay an initiation fee, which secures their room and board with the gang. Ratz can then either bribe their way up the hierarchy with cheese or work for the good of the gang to earn the respect of their fellow members.","Once Ratz have undergone the initiation, they become novice “Gang Members,” who serve to do the grunt work of the gang. They do the bidding of their superiors, with more completed tasks earning them additional respect in the gang, which helps them advance. While the novices don’t earn much in terms of cheese, they do earn enough to survive. Gang members also have a strong bond with their fellow gang Ratz.","After Ratz have earned enough respect and experience in the gang, they can advance to the intermediate “Captain” level. These Ratz help keep the lower gang members in check, ensuring none of them get into mischief. Captains earn more cheese than novice gang members. One of their chief roles is to coordinate social events for the gang. Captains seem to serve as the glue that holds the tight-knit gangs together.","At the top of the pecking order is the Gang Boss. These Ratz are the wealthiest and most experienced. Gang Bosses are entitled to the largest portions of the gang’s cheese supplies. They are the most respected among the ranks and tend to live in the most luxurious living quarters. Rumors have spread among the sewers that gang bosses have furniture made from pure chhurpi cheese. For those who are not cheese aficionados, chhurpi is the hardest cheese in the world.","Once attaining the position of gang boss, Ratz are given a rare serum to further alter their genetics. One of the main effects of this is the gang boss grows hair, which helps to differentiate them from the lower tier Ratz. Gang bosses are the only ones capable of organizing raids on rival gangs, as well as negotiating treaties with other gang bosses.","The Rogue Ratz were not especially forthcoming about the details of the initiation, but according to available reports, prospective members can expect to face a philosophy exam, sneaking test, fitness challenge, and a banjo contest over the course of three days.","The Academics said they are looking for potential members with certain qualities. Ideal candidates enjoy consuming and discussing literature and philosophy. These Ratz tend to be perfectionists who demand excellence. They are all organized and present themselves with a prim and proper attitude and elegant aesthetic.","Those Ratz hoping to join the Crooks would be skilled in the areas of sneakiness and deception. All potential Crooks must be brave, as their lifestyle comes with quite a bit of danger and risk. Fitness is a must for these Ratz because running from the Solana City Police will be guaranteed gang activity. Ideal Crooks candidates are carefree, with a relaxed attitude toward laws, and deep enjoyment of adrenaline-fueled pursuits.","The Hillbillies are slightly more relaxed when it comes to their requirements. Chief among their requests for prospective members is the ability to hold their liquor. As many know, the Hillbillies are known for their potent moonshine. Musical talent is a plus, but not necessarily required. However, a love of music—country in particular— is an absolute necessity. Hard-working Ratz with excellent marksmanship will be ideal candidates for this gang.","With the human residents of Solana City now fully aware of the Rogue Ratz, could potential migration to the surface be on the horizon for the city’s sewer population? Or will the subterranean citizens remain separate? Keep an eye on the Solana Tribune for more information on this developing story as it becomes available."]}],[{"l":"The Crooks","p":["Reclusive Rogue Ratz Crooks shun human world","By Serena Massof","Investigative Reporter","SOLANA CITY— Just like the humans above, the Rogue Ratz have a criminal element. The self-proclaimed Crooks gang runs the thriving black market that supplies goods to all the Solana Sewers, as well as growing the “sweetest, stinkiest weed in town,” according to one Crooks member.","Many of the Crooks shun humanity entirely and refused to share their experiences for this article. However, after some persuasion, and this reporter suspects, bribery from the Academics, the Crooks agreed to appoint a team of Ratz to speak.","The Crooks formed under the guidance of Charlene “Charlie” Cheddar. Before the Ratz monarchy fell, Cheddar was already an accomplished thief. Surviving records indicate that when humanity rejected the Ratz, Cheddar rejected them right back. She had absolutely no respect for human laws or property ownership. If she could steal it from the surface, it was hers.","Cheddar made a fortune for herself stealing from ships in the Solana Harbor, but she was eventually caught by a sailor. According to stories passed down through the ranks of the Crooks, Cheddar said she was scared the sailor would turn her over to the police. In accordance with the law, the police would immediately take her to the Rat Trap, the specially designed prison former Mayor Portculli built to hold Rogue Ratz. However, the sailor was impressed by Cheddar’s skill and proposed a partnership instead.","The sailor, who remains unnamed in every record available, offered Cheddar a job sneaking illicit goods into Solana City via the sewer system. She was reluctant to partner with a human at first, but Cheddar ultimately agreed, and the Solana black market was born.","Cheddar proved to be adept as a criminal mastermind. She joined the ranks of the Solana City underworld crime scene, where she quickly became a power player— above and below ground. Before the law banning marijuana was changed, records indicate a bag containing live seeds was thrown into the sewer and Cheddar seized the opportunity to expand her empire. Thanks to the lingering traces of the original toxic contamination that mutated the Ratz, the marijuana strain they produce, Super Green Sewer Slime, is dominating the markets, both through illicit and recently, legal channels.","Rumors among the gangs say the Crooks are working with multiple strains in the hopes of creating the most potent marijuana known to both humans and Ratz.","The Crooks’ area of the Solana Sewers is slathered in red, perhaps as a warning to keep out the unwelcome. While most of the Crooks wear red in some fashion, those who must commit their thievery in the shadows tend to do so in a more discreet fashion. They wear splashes of red in the form of accessories to their black wardrobes, which help them remain unseen on the surface. Members of the Crooks do not shy away from the illegality of their interests. Many said their hobbies included stealing, selling narcotics, and playing pranks— particularly on humans. They also enjoy hoarding items and playing video games. The Crooks proudly showed off a massive flat-screen television and a series of gaming systems.","“We stole them right off the truck and they didn’t see a thing!” said Crooks member Benedict Bleu.","Personality traits are difficult to gauge among a group so standoffish to humans, but there are several commonalities among the Crooks. They are reclusive to both humans and other Ratz gangs. They are friendly and open only among other Crooks. These Ratz are openly sneaky and easily agitated, with edgy attitudes that often place them at odds with others.","Whether the Crooks continue their lawless ways or branch into more legitimate avenues of business remains to be seen, but many residents of Solana City are eager to learn more about the most reclusive of the Rogue Ratz population."]}],[{"l":"The Crooks","p":["Self-proclaimed Hillbilly Rogue Ratz seek a simple life","By Serena Massof","Investigative Reporter","SOLANA CITY— “If your life was as short as mine, wouldn’t you spend it having fun, too?” said Hillbilly Harold Havarti.","This seems to be a common sentiment among the self-proclaimed Hillbilly gang of the Rogue Ratz. The gang, who are known for their laid-back attitudes, country music, and potent moonshine, said they just want to live a simple life and enjoy themselves.","The Hillbillies don’t have much in the form of written history, but they do have a series of rather moving oral histories set to song. While they are considered uneducated, this reporter found many of them to be intelligent and talented musicians. They are, however, utterly uninterested in a structured way of life.","Power has never been an issue in the sewers, and thanks to the Crooks’ smuggling connections, most of the Ratz are frequent consumers of television and video games. Hillbillies founder Billy Brie was always a fan of the Dukes brothers and had long been a lover of the dulcet tones of banjo music. When he discovered a banjo floating in the sewer rapids, Brie swam out to get it. According to Hillbilly history, Brie strummed the strings and knew it was destiny.","Brie taught himself to play the theme song from his favorite show and the sweet sounds of his banjo drew in others. Soon, a group had formed, and it wasn’t long until the moonshine still started brewing and a deal was made to sell it on the black market. Members of the Hillbillies said they do whatever they want, and they make moonshine to pay the bills. Several members said they would be interested in expanding their territory to increase the booming moonshine business.","Rumors among the Ratz say Solana City’s new mayor is a shareholder in the Hillbillies’ moonshine business. Perhaps relations with the surface are further along than they seem?","When visiting the Hillbillies, expect to see sewer rapid surfing, video game tournaments, and Ratz living their lives to the fullest. While this group has no interest in migrating to the surface, many said they wouldn’t mind being allowed to visit now and then. Particularly to perform with the other musicians at the Solana City Park and to test the merit of their moonshine against the best humanity has to offer.","Their hobbies include playing music— especially the banjo— drinking moonshine, grilling up some delicious Halloumi cheese, and gathering for their weekly stand-up comedy nights. Hillbillies can also often be found practicing their marksmanship on bottles at their shooting range.","The Hillbillies live under one of the oldest bakeries in Solana City. Havarti said the location allows access to yeast, which is a necessary ingredient in the potent moonshine they produce. The Hillbillies’ area of the sewers shines with yellow, recalling lazy, laid-back sunny days. They also prefer denim overalls with yellow shirts.","Several members of the Hillbillies said they are more content than their Rogue Ratz counterparts because they don’t focus on ambition. Their personalities tend toward a relaxed attitude and a simple manner. They are hard-working people who are generally friendly but don’t hesitate to retaliate once they’ve been crossed. They are, however, territorial and don’t appreciate unwelcome visitors.","“When y’all keep life simple, it’s not hard to be happy,” said Hillbilly Jethro Feta. “The secret is not to want too much. A well-tuned banjo, some strong bleu cheese, and friendly company. That’s all y’all need.”"]}],[{"l":"The Academics","p":["Academic Rogue Ratz seek knowledge, life on the surface","By Serena Massof","Investigative Reporter","SOLANA CITY— Shortly after the monarchy of Queen Gorgonzola was dissolved, the Rogue Ratz community fractured into three factions. This article delves into the history of the Academics gang, founded by Sir Alfred Gouda, and what inspires these Ratz.","The Academics make their home in the sewers underneath the Solana Public Library. The gang’s records are extensive from the point of their founding on, something the other gangs lack. They shared their knowledge readily enough, as the Academics seek a partnership with the surface world where they would be free to continue learning.","Before Sir Alfred Gouda, reading was seen as a luxury only available to the incredibly wealthy. He found a book washed up in the sewer and taught himself to read. Sir Gouda quickly gathered a following of like-minded Ratz and formed the Academics gang.","The Academics favor an elegant high-society aesthetic. They prefer brie cheese and crackers served on an ornate table and particularly enjoy fine dining among friends. Their favorite pastimes include reading novels and studying literature to discuss with one another, as well as watching intellectual movies that promote intelligent conversation.","Their area of the Solana Sewers is inundated with green. The Academics’ clothes, their walls, and even many of their personal items. It feels almost like walking into a park on the surface. Perhaps that is why the Academics favor it so much?","Several personality traits become apparent upon spending a significant amount of time with the Academics. They are intelligent, sophisticated, and proud, but they also tend toward arrogance and self-entitlement. Members of the other gangs said the Academics have a superior attitude, bordering on rude, regarding other Ratz, while idolizing humans. The Academics, however, insist they are “merely selective about those with whom they choose to associate.”","Rumors in the Solana Sewers indicate the Academics are “obsessed with becoming human” and that they have a secret lab deep in the sewers where they are working on a serum that would allow them to become human. This reporter witnessed no evidence of a lab or any kind of serum, though they did not answer any questions related to the rumors.","Sufficient evidence exists to suggest that members of the Academics partake in the thriving black market run by the Crooks. Several gang members said they despise the necessity, but “no one can procure goods like the Crooks.” While the Academics shun the pleasure-seeking behaviors of the other two gangs, they do admit the others have their usefulness.","Academics members said they would like more control over the Rogue Ratz community to improve the public relations between Ratz and humans."]}]]
