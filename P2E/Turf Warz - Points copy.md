# Gang Wars

It takes more than pledging â€”. 

Making it to the top has its perks. Gang bosses head the Academic, Hillbilly & Thieve Gangs. Gang Bosses propose decisions to the Gangs whilst Gang members vote on these proposals. 

Gang Bosses also receive bonus Cheese rewards - making them the biggest earners in sewers.

- $CHEESE + 3x Gang Rat = **Gang Boss**
- Staked Gang Bosses are rewarded with $CHEESE & DAO tokens
- Gang Bosses DAO tokens to make proposals to the Gang DAO
